# PACTALK

Our project is a Python-based PacMan game that allows players to control/play the game using voice commands, though keyboard input is also available. What makes our game unique is its focus on voice-driven gameplay, offering an accessible alternative to traditional PacMan. This feature aims to enhance accessibility for individuals with temporary or permanent motor disabilities, providing an inclusive gaming experience for anyone who prefers to play with their voice. We hope this application opens up new opportunities for enjoyment and engagement with classic games like PacMan!
