# PACTALK

Our project is a Python PacMan game that uses voice commands to play, but you may also use the keyboard if you wish. Our game is unique since it offers the ability to play with your voice alone which aims to increase accessibility to traditional games such as PacMan. We hope this game can help people with temporary or permanent motor disabilities enjoy the game and those who wish to play it with their voices!
